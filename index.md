# CREST Docs

Welcome to the documentation site of {% include tooltip.html tool="CREST" tip=site.data.glossary.crest %}.



{% include image.html file="crest.png" alt="CREST" max-width=250 %}

## Introduction

CREST is a utility and driver program for the semiempirical quantum chemistry package [`xtb`{% include elink.html %}](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb).
The programs name originated as an abbreviation for Conformerâ€“Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool as it was developed as a program for conformational sampling at the extended tight-binding level GFN-xTB.
Since then several functionalities have been added to the code.
In its current state, the program provides a variety of sampling procedures, for example for improved thermochemistry, or solvation.
Generally, CREST functions as an IO-based scheduler for the `xtb` program and as tool for analyzing structure ensembles.

The key procedure implemented in CREST is a conformational search workflow abbreviated as iMTD-GC. 
This workflow generates conformer/rotamer ensembles by extensive metadynamics-based sampling.
Other notable standalone functionalities are automated detection and ranking of protonation sites and the quantum cluster growth (QCG) workflow for explicit solvation.

This documentation aims to provide a practical installation guide and a series of example applications.
Quick links to different sections of the documentation can be found below.
